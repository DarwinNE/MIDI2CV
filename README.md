# MIDI2CV
A minimalistic MIDI2CV module based on PIC16F876 for an analog synth

This project has been started in January 2007, as part of an analog synth
project. Since I have done pretty much started from scratch, it turned out
that it took a very long time to obtain something functional.
For the moment, I built the MIDI2CV module as well as a VCO, LFVCO, VCA, ADSR
and a CV adder that I put in a wooden box originally meant to contain fine
wines. This is still an ongoing project, sometimes I take the time to add
something and this is rather easy in a modular synth project.
